### School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Analyzing the city school district data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. We have been asked to provide insights about performance trends from standardized tests and patterns occuring within the school district. These insights will be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. The city school district has tasked us with using these insights to determine if there is a correlation between school performance and its funding, student population, or the school types (charter or district).  

The city school ditrcit board also determined that there is evidence of academic dishonesty, specifcally, the math and reading grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. As a result, we refractored our script parameters to ensure the analysis results for per student averages wouldn't be skewed and incorrectly influence the school boards strategic decisions.
